# Hello,

My name is **Jeonghwan**.

I live in **Brisbane**, Australia and I am studying **Web development**.

I created this blog to post my projects and to record what I've studied.

It is so hard to remember everything... so I needed to organize what I've studied and had to see again and again. This is why I named my blog **'My external hippocampus'** which is our brain part in charge of long term memory haha..

I am interested in building websites by using **MERN** stack.

At the moment, I am studying about **UX/UI** development such as Canvas, SVG libraries and animation, design tools for implementing interactive design functions.

**Thank you** for visiting my blog and I hope you to find information you want...!
