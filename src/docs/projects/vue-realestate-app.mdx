## Description

After I learned how to make WordPress Theme, I realised how important components are and I chose Vue to learn JavaScript framework.

### Landing Page

I put style guide, simple layout, designs for unit page, detail page and modal.

### Unit Page

#### vue router

I used vue-router so if user click the photo on the card components, it shows modal carousel which has previous and next buttons and number buttons for each page.

#### modal

If user click outside of the photo on the card components, it shows detail page for each unit.

#### scroll effect

On detail page, I used scroll effect which changes images size and opacity when scroll position changes.
