## Description

I was wondering how frontend and backend work together, how they can be connected to each other and how to get data from database through server or send data and save permanently, so I created todo app.

### Stack

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongodb

### Libraries

- Mongoose
- Axios

I used react for frontend side and node.js express for the sever side and mongodb for database. I also used axios library to send AJAX request from frontend and mongoose to connect my server and db and to make a schema model.
