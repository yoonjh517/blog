## Description

I wanted to know how client, server and database work together and how to read, create, update, delete data, so I made a todo app by using on React JavaScript library for frontend, Express.js for server and MongoDB for database.

To connect my server to database and make a schema model, I used Mongoose library and Axios library for AJAX request.
