## Description

I wanted to make a blog on WordPress platform so I learned how to use themes, starter templates, plugins and how to use elementor. After that, I also wanted to build my own simple custom theme.

MAMP is used to build the backend and FileZilla to deploy on AWS Lightsail and Bootstrap grid layout.
