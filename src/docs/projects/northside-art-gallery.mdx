## Description

After I finished my certificate III in Information Technology and Digital Media at TAFE South Bank, I did not feel very confident about applying for any job so I redesigned my project which I made at TAFE course.

I sketched with my hand first and made the layout, the style guide, the story board and the designs for both desktop and mobile web by using Figma.

It was my first own project and I didn't have much ideas about how to use JavaScript frameworks and my JavaScript skill was aweful so I wrote almost every JavaScript code in hard coding.
