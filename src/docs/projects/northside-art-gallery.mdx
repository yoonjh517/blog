## Description

After I finished my certificate III in Information Technology and Digital Media(web) course at TAFE South Bank, I didn't feel confident about applying for any job so I redesigned my project which I made at TAFE course.

I sketched with my hand first and made the layout, the style guide, the story board and the designs for both desktop and mobile web by using Figma.
